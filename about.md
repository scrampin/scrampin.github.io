I'm Steph and this is my blog.

I'm learning to be a software developer at Makers Academy, and this is where I'll be posting my thoughts on what I have learned and how I am feeling. I will try to write a post at least every other day.

I do other things as well as learning to code, so expect periodic updates on those. Topics that are important to me include running, effective altruism, and my thoughts on wellbeing.
