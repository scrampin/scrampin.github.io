<h2>1: Doubles are not terrifying</h2>

<p>I had been taught about mocks and doubles before in a lecture style format, and I had not understood much.
 I didn’t understand the point, I didn’t understand what the object I was making really was, and I didn’t
  understand why it made everything break when it worked fine before. When I hears the word double, I heard
   it in my lecturer’s voice, and a Pavlovian sense of dread started to set in. All I had to do to relieve
    this dread was just experiment with the idea myself a few times. Turns out it does exist for a reason,
     and when used properly, makes the test cases I’m using much more fit for purpose.</p>

<p>Also! I found out you can use doubles in irb using require 'rspec/mocks/standalone', which is super useful.</p>

<h2>2: Experimenting is key</h2>

<p>I find irb a little intimidating and I shouldn’t. The best way you can understand how your code works is to
 play with it as much as possible in the terminal. There is no excuse for not testing or exploring an idea
  just because it would be a hassle to run the program or write a class in irb. When I complete a project after
   a tonne of experimenting is the time I learn the most.</p>

<h2>3. Interfaces and private methods</h2>

<p>This one is related to both best practice and actual instances of code. The instance in question was a
 piece in our project walkthrough which encouraged us to make an attribute reader private. We were all
  confused as to why this was, as our test cases made reference to the method created by this attribute reader.
   The question in my mind was “why would I make this private when I need to refer to it elsewhere?”
    After a workshop it became much clearer that I should not be using it elsewhere; instead I should be using
     the interface I was designing.</p>
